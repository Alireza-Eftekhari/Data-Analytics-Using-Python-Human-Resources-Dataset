Anually, around one quarter of all U.S. workers quit their jobs, and in some industries the turnover rate is considerably higher. Nowadays, the company that has more engaged and productive employees will have a better chance of winning market competition. For this reason, companies can not lose important employees and when that begins to happen we need to understand why, to prevent this from happening.\n","A large company named AEKK, with around 4000 employees, face with high rate of human resources turnover. Anually, around 15% of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market. management believes that this level of attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company. because of the following reasons:\n","•\tThe former employees’ projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet timelines, resulting in a reputation loss among consumers and partners\n","•\tA sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purposes of recruiting new talent\n","•\tMore often than not, the new employees have to be trained for the job and/or given time to acclimatise themselves to the company\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"OkeLWzynxxSg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Our Dataset:**\n","\n","The dataset contains 28 features which are to be used for predicting the probability of whether an employee will leave the company or not.
